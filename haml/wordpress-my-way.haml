							Once I installed Wordpress for a first time, and didn't like what I saw: The default theme just didn't cut it. 
							So, I made my own. The thing I learned is that I will not do it again. Unless I really have to. 
							It can be constant uphill battle to fix fundamentals of a good user experience.
							Though I did get it done, return for time invested was not that great.
							The good thing is that after I have walked the walk, I know what to look for when on theme-shopping spree. This article is opionated.

							%span.bold Attention reader:
							This article was written 2012 in comparison to twenty-eleven, the default theme at that time.
							Though some of the points have been fixed in later iterations, some still apply.

							Ones location in the site hierarchy is indicated with a slightly bolder font on the item. On some cases your location is not detected at all. This can make it harder to create a mental model about the sites hierarchy and affects the sense of location. There is no indicator for a menu dropdown (like a small arrow), which makes it harder to understand all available options before further exploring.

							Tabbed menu allows users to better locate themselves in the hierarcy of the site. Dropdown items are displayed on a single row below the currently selected tab, which makes it also accessible for touch devices.

							Single article template
						%p
							This is a deadend. Only way to discover new content is by using next/previous links or by tags, which are not very visible feature in the user interface. One can't see what's lying beneath these links, which can reduce the amount of new content found through an impulse. All in all there is no simple way of finding related content to this article, and no way to find it without further page loads.

							Recommendations help users to find new articles suggested by their interests in a simple and effortless way. As this is an element with high contrast due to pictures, its more likely to catch ones eye. A solution like this can increase time single visitor spends on a website.

							Location and visualization of labels and buttons does not follow conventions and require extra effort to spot.

							Category-page
						%p
							Category details doesn't stand out from other content. This is the only visual piece, which differentiates this view from the view on front page. Coupled with the problem with menu poorly indicating your location, it's easy to get confused about your whereabouts in the hierarchy of the site.
							%img(src="./img/content/p04.jpg")
							%img(src="./img/content/p05.jpg")
						%h4.regular.subheader My fix
						%p
							Increased contrast between category details and other content to clearly differentiate category-page from frontpage. As it is more about browsing content, only thumbnails and excerpts are displayed instead of full articles. This will make it easier to get a good overview of a category content. It also further differentiates category-page from frontpage.
