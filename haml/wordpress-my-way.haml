							Once I installed Wordpress for a first time, and didn't like what I saw: The default theme just didn't cut it. 
							So, I made my own. The thing I learned is that I will not do it again. Unless I really have to. 
							It can be constant uphill battle to fix fundamentals of a good user experience.
							Though I did get it done, return for time invested was not that great.
							The good thing is that after I have walked the walk, I know what to look for when on theme-shopping spree.

							%span.bold Attention reader:
							This article was written 2012 in comparison to twenty-eleven, the default theme at that time.
							Though some of the points have been fixed in later iterations, some still apply.

								Location in the site hierarchy is indicated with a slightly bolder font on the item, which is hard to detect. This can make it difficult to create a mental model about sites hierarchy and can affect the sense of location. Data displayed in dropdown is only available by hovering over a item. This means it's not accessible with touch devices. There is no indicator for a submenu (like a small arrow), which can make it harder to discover items with a dropdown.

								Tabbed menu allows users to better locate themselves in the hierarcy of the site. Dropdown items are displayed on a single row below the currently selected tab, which makes it also accessible for touch devices.

								Single article template
							%p
								This is a deadend. Only way to discover new content is by using next/previous links or by tags, which are not very visible feature in the user interface. One can't see what's lying beneath these links, which can reduce the amount of new content found through an impulse. All in all there is no simple way of finding related content to this article, and no way to find it without further page loads.

								Recommendations help users to find new articles suggested by their interests in a simple and effortless way. As this is an element with high contrast due to pictures, its more likely to catch ones eye. A solution like this can increase time single visitor spends on a website.

								Category-page
							%p
								Category title and description does not stand out from other content. This is the only visual piece, which differentiates this view from the view on the front page. Coupled with the problem with menu poorly indicating your location, it's easy to get confused about your whereabouts in the hierarchy of the site.

							%h4.regular.subheader My fix
							%p
								Increased contrast between category details and other content to better communicate your current location. As it is more about browsing content, only thumbnails and excerpts are displayed instead of full articles. This will make it easier to get a good overview of a category content. It also further differentiates category-page from frontpage.
