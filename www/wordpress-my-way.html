              Once I installed Wordpress for a first time, and didn't like what I saw: The default theme just didn't cut it.
              So, I made my own. The thing I learned is that I will not do it again. Unless I really have to.
              It can be constant uphill battle to fix some fundamentals of a good user experience.
              Yes, I'm looking at you hover-with-no-sense-of-location-or-state-menus.
              Though I did get it done, return for time invested was not that great.
              The good thing is that after I have walked the walk, I know what to look for when on theme-shopping spree.

              This article was written 2012 in comparison to twenty-eleven, the default theme at that time.
              Though some of the points have been fixed in later iterations, some still apply.
            </p>
            <h3>Problem #1</h3>
            <p>
              Menu doesn't indicate current location of user or indicator is ambigious.
              <img src='./img/content/p01.jpg'>
            </p>
            <h3>Fix #1</h3>
            <p>
              Tabbed menu allows users to better locate themselves in the hierarcy of the site.
              <img src='./img/content/f01.jpg'>
            </p>
            <h3>Problem #2</h3>
            <p>
              Navigation between articles is in the scope of all posts, though users may come through filtered listing.
              <img src='./img/content/p02.jpg'>
            </p>
            <h3>Fix #2</h3>
            <p>
              Recommendations help users to find new articles suggested by their interests. This can increase time single user spends on a website.
              <img src='./img/content/f02.jpg'>
            </p>
            <h3>Problem #3</h3>
            <p>
              Location and visualization of labels and buttons does not follow conventions and require extra effort to spot.
              <img src='./img/content/p03.jpg'>
            </p>
            <h3>Fix #3</h3>
            <p>
              Conventional placement and visualization of labels and buttons.
              <img src='./img/content/f03.jpg'>
            </p>
            <h3>Problem #4</h3>
            <p>
              Category listing doesn't stand out from other content. Coupled with the problem with menu, it's hard to locate yourself in the hierarchy of the website.
              <img src='./img/content/p04.jpg'>
            </p>
            <h3>Fix #4</h3>
            <p>
              Increased contrast between category details and other content.
              <img src='./img/content/f04.jpg'>
            </p>
            <h3>Problem #5</h3>
            <p>
              Category listing displays full articles, which makes it hard to scan all available content.
              <img src='./img/content/p05.jpg'>
            </p>
            <h3>Fix #5</h3>
            <p>
              Display thumbnail and excerpt from article in category listings. Browsing by category is more about finding interest. This helps users to get better and quicker overview of available content.

            I go for simple and elegant solutions. For me, high quality is
            matter of principle. Though my strengths lie within interaction
            design and technical implementation, I know a little bit of
            everything. Thus, I can see things in a broader perspective.

            I'm pretty good on my own, but at my best I'm when teamed
            up with talented people from other disciplines.
            I believe in team efforts.
